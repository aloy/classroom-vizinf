  title     = "Variations of {Q--Q} Plots: The Power of Our Eyes!",
  author    = "Loy, Adam and Follett, Lendie and Hofmann, Heike",
  abstract  = "AbstractIn statistical modeling, we strive to specify models
               that resemble data collected in studies or observed from
               processes. Consequently, distributional specification and
               parameter estimation are central to parametric models. Graphical
               procedures, such as the quantile?quantile (Q?Q) plot, are
               arguably the most widely used method of distributional
               assessment, though critics find their interpretation to be
               overly subjective. Formal goodness of fit tests are available
               and are quite powerful, but only indicate whether there is a
               lack of fit, not why there is lack of fit. In this article, we
               explore the use of the lineup protocol to inject rigor into
               graphical distributional assessment and compare its power to
               that of formal distributional tests. We find that lineup tests
               are considerably more powerful than traditional tests of
               normality. A further investigation into the design of Q?Q plots
               shows that de-trended Q?Q plots are more powerful than the
               standard approach as long as the plot preserves distances in x
               and y to be the same. While we focus on diagnosing nonnormality,
               our approach is general and can be directly extended to the
               assessment of other distributions.",

  author    = "VanderPlas, Susan and Hofmann, Heike",
  abstract  = "Graphical representations have to be true to the data they
               display. Computational tools ensure this on a technical level.
               But we also need to take ?flaws? of the human perceptual system
               into account. The sine illusion provides an example where human
               perception leads to systematic bias in the assessment of the
               optical stimulus, with a particularly notable impact on
               perception of time-series data with a seasonal component. In
               this article, we discuss the reasons for the illusion and
               various strategies useful to break the illusion or reduce its
               strength. We demonstrate the presence of the illusion in
               real-world and theoretical situations. We also present data from
               a user study, which demonstrate the dramatic effect the sine
               illusion can have on conclusions drawn from displayed data.",
